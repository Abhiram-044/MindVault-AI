Abstract
The correct use of model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection
techniques is vital in academic machine learning research as well as in many
industrial settings. This article reviews different techniques that can be used for
each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages
of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further,
recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and
applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method
for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended
when working with small datasets. Different ﬂavors of the bootstrap technique
are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an
alternative to conﬁdence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is
computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-one-
out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance
trade-off for choosingk is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of
k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm
comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons
such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed. Finally,
alternative methods for algorithm selection, such as the combinedF -test 5x2 cross-
validation and nested cross-validation, are recommended for comparing machine
learning algorithms when datasets are small.

1 Introduction: Essential Model Evaluation Terms and Techniques
Machine learning has become a central part of our life – as consumers, customers, and hopefully
as researchers and practitioners. Whether we are applying predictive modeling techniques to our
research or business problems, I believe we have one thing in common: We want to make "good"
predictions. Fitting a model to our training data is one thing, but how do we know that it generalizes
well to unseen data? How do we know that it does not simply memorize the data we fed it and fails to
make good predictions on future samples, samples that it has not seen before? And how do we select
a good model in the ﬁrst place? Maybe a different learning algorithm could be better-suited for the
problem at hand?
Model evaluation is certainly not just the end point of our machine learning pipeline. Before we
handle any data, we want to plan ahead and use techniques that are suited for our purposes. In this
article, we will go over a selection of these techniques, and we will see how they ﬁt into the bigger
picture, a typical machine learning workﬂow.
1.1 Performance Estimation: Generalization Performance vs. Model Selection
Let us consider the obvious question, "How do we estimate the performance of a machine learning
model?" A typical answer to this question might be as follows: "First, we feed the training data
to our learning algorithm to learn a model. Second, we predict the labels of our test set. Third,
we count the number of wrong predictions on the test dataset to compute the model’s prediction
accuracy." Depending on our goal, however, estimating the performance of a model is not that trivial,
unfortunately. Maybe we should address the previous question from a different angle: "Why do we
care about performance estimates at all?" Ideally, the estimated performance of a model tells how
well it performs on unseen data – making predictions on future data is often the main problem we
want to solve in applications of machine learning or the development of new algorithms. Typically,
machine learning involves a lot of experimentation, though – for example, the tuning of the internal
knobs of a learning algorithm, the so-called hyperparameters. Running a learning algorithm over a
training dataset with different hyperparameter settings will result in different models. Since we are
typically interested in selecting the best-performing model from this set, we need to ﬁnd a way to
estimate their respective performances in order to rank them against each other.
Going one step beyond mere algorithm ﬁne-tuning, we are usually not only experimenting with
the one single algorithm that we think would be the "best solution" under the given circumstances.
More often than not, we want to compare different algorithms to each other, oftentimes in terms of
predictive and computational performance. Let us summarize the main points why we evaluate the
predictive performance of a model:
1. We want to estimate the generalization performance, the predictive performance of our
model on future (unseen) data.
2. We want to increase the predictive performance by tweaking the learning algorithm and
selecting the best performing model from a given hypothesis space.
3. We want to identify the machine learning algorithm that is best-suited for the problem at
hand; thus, we want to compare different algorithms, selecting the best-performing one as
well as the best performing model from the algorithm’s hypothesis space.
Although these three sub-tasks listed above have all in common that we want to estimate the
performance of a model, they all require different approaches. We will discuss some of the different
methods for tackling these sub-tasks in this article.
Of course, we want to estimate the future performance of a model as accurately as possible. However,
we shall note that biased performance estimates are perfectly okay in model selection and algorithm
selection if the bias affects all models equally. If we rank different models or algorithms against each
other in order to select the best-performing one, we only need to know their "relative" performance.
For example, if all performance estimates are pessimistically biased, and we underestimate their
performances by 10%, it will not affect the ranking order. More concretely, if we obtaind three
models with prediction accuracy estimates such as
M2: 75% > M1: 70% > M3: 65%,
4
we would still rank them the same way if we added a 10% pessimistic bias:
M2: 65% > M1: 60% > M3: 55%.
However, note that if we reported the generalization (future prediction) accuracy of the best ranked
model (M2) to be 65%, this would obviously be quite inaccurate. Estimating the absolute performance
of a model is probably one of the most challenging tasks in machine learning.
1.2 Assumptions and Terminology
Model evaluation is certainly a complex topic. To make sure that we do not diverge too much from
the core message, let us make certain assumptions and go over some of the technical terms that we
will use throughout this article.
i.i.d. We assume that the training examples are i.i.d (independent and identically distributed), which
means that all examples have been drawn from the same probability distribution and are statistically
independent from each other. A scenario where training examples are not independent would be
working with temporal data or time-series data.
Supervised learning and classiﬁcation. This article focusses on supervised learning, a subcategory
of machine learning where the target values are known in a given dataset. Although many concepts
also apply to regression analysis, we will focus on classiﬁcation, the assignment of categorical target
labels to the training and test examples.
0-1 loss and prediction accuracy. In the following article, we will focus on the prediction accuracy,
which is deﬁned as the number of all correct predictions divided by the number of examples in the
dataset. We compute the prediction accuracy as the number of correct predictions divided by the
number of examplesn. Or in more formal terms, we deﬁne the prediction accuracy ACC as
ACC = 1− ERR, (1)
where the prediction error, ERR, is computed as the expected value of the 0-1 loss overn examples
in a datasetS:
ERRS = 1
n
n∑
i=1
L( ˆyi,yi). (2)
The 0-1 lossL(·) is deﬁned as
L( ˆyi,yi) =



0 if ˆyi =yi
1 if ˆyi̸=yi,
(3)
whereyi is theith true class label and ˆyi theith predicted class label, respectively. Our objective is to
learn a modelh that has a good generalization performance. Such a model maximizes the prediction
accuracy or, vice versa, minimizes the probability,C(h), of making a wrong prediction:
C(h) = Pr
(x,y)∼D
[h(x)̸=y]. (4)
Here,D is the generating distribution the dataset has been drawn from, x is the feature vector of a
training example with class labely.
Lastly, since this article mostly refers to the prediction accuracy (instead of the error), we deﬁne
Kronecker’s Delta function:
δ
(
L( ˆyi,yi)
)
= 1−L( ˆyi,yi), (5)
5
such that
δ
(
L( ˆyi,yi)
)
= 1 if ˆyi =yi (6)
and
δ
(
L( ˆyi,yi)
)
= 0 if ˆyi̸=yi. (7)
Bias. Throughout this article, the term bias refers to the statistical bias (in contrast to the bias in a
machine learning system). In general terms, the bias of an estimator ˆβ is the difference between its
expected valueE[ ˆβ] and the true value of a parameterβ being estimated:
Bias =E[ ˆβ]−β. (8)
Thus, if Bias =E[ ˆβ]−β = 0, then ˆβ is an unbiased estimator ofβ. More concretely, we compute
the prediction bias as the difference between the expected prediction accuracy of a model and its
true prediction accuracy. For example, if we computed the prediction accuracy on the training set,
this would be an optimistically biased estimate of the absolute accuracy of a model since it would
overestimate its true accuracy.
Variance. The variance is simply the statistical variance of the estimator ˆβ and its expected value
E[ ˆβ], for instance, the squared difference of the :
Variance =E
[(ˆβ−E[ ˆβ]
)2]
. (9)
The variance is a measure of the variability of a model’s predictions if we repeat the learning process
multiple times with small ﬂuctuations in the training set. The more sensitive the model-building
process is towards these ﬂuctuations, the higher the variance.1
Finally, let us disambiguate the terms model, hypothesis, classiﬁer, learning algorithms, and parame-
ters:
Target function. In predictive modeling, we are typically interested in modeling a particular
process; we want to learn or approximate a speciﬁc, unknown function. The target functionf(x) =y
is the true functionf(·) that we want to model.
Hypothesis. A hypothesis is a certain function that we believe (or hope) is similar to the true
function, the target functionf(·) that we want to model. In context of spam classiﬁcation, it would
be a classiﬁcation rule we came up with that allows us to separate spam from non-spam emails.
Model. In the machine learning ﬁeld, the termshypothesis and model are often used interchangeably.
In other sciences, these terms can have different meanings: A hypothesis could be the "educated
guess" by the scientist, and the model would be the manifestation of this guess to test this hypothesis.
Learning algorithm. Again, our goal is to ﬁnd or approximate the target function, and the learning
algorithm is a set of instructions that tried to model the target function using a training dataset. A
learning algorithm comes with a hypothesis space, the set of possible hypotheses it can explore to
model the unknown target function by formulating the ﬁnal hypothesis.

high variance relates to overﬁtting and high bias relates to underﬁtting, please see my lecture notes I

eval-intro/08_eval-intro_notes.pdf.

Hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are the tuning parameters of a machine learning algorithm –
for example, the regularization strength of an L2 penalty in the loss function of logistic regression, or
a value for setting the maximum depth of a decision tree classiﬁer. In contrast, model parameters
are the parameters that a learning algorithm ﬁts to the training data – the parameters of the model
itself. For example, the weight coefﬁcients (or slope) of a linear regression line and its bias term
(here: y-axis intercept) are model parameters.
1.3 Resubstitution Validation and the Holdout Method
The holdout method is inarguably the simplest model evaluation technique; it can be summarized as
follows. First, we take a labeled dataset and split it into two parts: A training and a test set. Then, we
ﬁt a model to the training data and predict the labels of the test set. The fraction of correct predictions,
which can be computed by comparing the predicted labels to the ground truth labels of the test set,
constitutes our estimate of the model’s prediction accuracy. Here, it is important to note that we
do not want to train and evaluate a model on the same training dataset (this is calledresubstitution
validation or resubstitution evaluation), since it would typically introduce a very optimistic bias due
to overﬁtting. In other words, we cannot tell whether the model simply memorized the training data,
or whether it generalizes well to new, unseen data. (On a side note, we can estimate this so-called
optimism bias as the difference between the training and test accuracy.)
Typically, the splitting of a dataset into training and test sets is a simple process ofrandom subsam-
pling. We assume that all data points have been drawn from the same probability distribution (with
respect to each class). And we randomly choose 2/3 of these samples for the training set and 1/3
of the samples for the test set. Note that there are two problems with this approach, which we will
discuss in the next sections.
1.4 Stratiﬁcation
We have to keep in mind that a dataset represents a random sample drawn from a probability
distribution, and we typically assume that this sample is representative of the true population – more
or less. Now, further subsampling without replacement alters the statistic (mean, proportion, and
variance) of the sample. The degree to which subsampling without replacement affects the statistic of
a sample is inversely proportional to the size of the sample. Let us have a look at an example using
the Iris dataset 2, which we randomly divide into 2/3 training data and 1/3 test data as illustrated in
Figure 1. (The source code for generating this graphic is available on GitHub3.)
When we randomly divide a labeled dataset into training and test sets, we violate the assumption
of statistical independence. The Iris datasets consists of 50 Setosa, 50 Versicolor, and 50 Virginica
ﬂowers; the ﬂower species are distributed uniformly:
• 33.3% Setosa
• 33.3% Versicolor
• 33.3% Virginica
If a random function assigns 2/3 of the ﬂowers (100) to the training set and 1/3 of the ﬂowers (50) to
the test set, it may yield the following (also shown in Figure 1):
• training set→ 38× Setosa, 28× Versicolor, 34× Virginica
• test set→ 12× Setosa, 22× Versicolor, 16× Virginica
Assuming that the Iris dataset is representative of the true population (for instance, assuming that
iris ﬂower species are distributed uniformly in nature), we just created two imbalanced datasets with
non-uniform class distributions. The class ratio that the learning algorithm uses to learn the model
is "38% / 28% / 34%." The test dataset that is used for evaluating the model is imbalanced as well,
and even worse, it is balanced in the "opposite" direction: "24% / 44% / 32%." Unless the learning
algorithm is completely insensitive to these perturbations, this is certainly not ideal. The problem
becomes even worse if a dataset has a high class imbalance upfront, prior to the random subsampling.

In the worst-case scenario, the test set may not contain any instance of a minority class at all. Thus,
a recommended practice is to divide the dataset in a stratiﬁed fashion. Here, stratiﬁcation simply
means that we randomly split a dataset such that each class is correctly represented in the resulting
subsets (the training and the test set) – in other words, stratiﬁcation is an approach to maintain the
original class proportion in resulting subsets.
It shall be noted that random subsampling in non-stratiﬁed fashion is usually not a big concern when
working with relatively large and balanced datasets. However, in my opinion, stratiﬁed resampling is
usually beneﬁcial in machine learning applications. Moreover, stratiﬁed sampling is incredibly easy
to implement, and Ron Kohavi provides empirical evidence [Kohavi, 1995] that stratiﬁcation has a
positive effect on the variance and bias of the estimate ink-fold cross-validation, a technique that
will be discussed later in this article.
1.5 Holdout Validation
Before diving deeper into the pros and cons of the holdout validation method, Figure 2 provides a
visual summary of this method that will be discussed in the following text.
Step 1. First, we randomly divide our available data into two subsets: a training and a test set.
Setting test data aside is a work-around for dealing with the imperfections of a non-ideal world, such
as limited data and resources, and the inability to collect more data from the generating distribution.
Here, the test set shall represent new, unseen data to the model; it is important that the test set is only
used once to avoid introducing bias when we estimating the generalization performance. Typically,
we assign 2/3 to the training set and 1/3 of the data to the test set. Other common training/test splits
are 60/40, 70/30, or 80/20 – or even 90/10 if the dataset is relatively large.
Step 2. After setting test examples aside, we pick a learning algorithm that we think could be
appropriate for the given problem. As a quick reminder regarding theHyperparameter Valuesdepicted
in Figure 2, hyperparameters are the parameters of our learning algorithm, or meta-parameters. And
we have to specify these hyperparameter values manually – the learning algorithm does not learn
these from the training data in contrast to the actual model parameters. Since hyperparameters are not

learned during model ﬁtting, we need some sort of "extra procedure" or "external loop" to optimize
these separately – this holdout approach is ill-suited for the task. So, for now, we have to go with some
ﬁxed hyperparameter values – we could use our intuition or the default parameters of an off-the-shelf
algorithm if we are using an existing machine learning library.
Step 3. After the learning algorithm ﬁt a model in the previous step, the next question is: How
"good" is the performance of the resulting model? This is where the independent test set comes into
play. Since the learning algorithm has not "seen" this test set before, it should provide a relatively
unbiased estimate of its performance on new, unseen data. Now, we take this test set and use the
model to predict the class labels. Then, we take the predicted class labels and compare them to the
"ground truth," the correct class labels, to estimate the models generalization accuracy or error.
Step 4. Finally, we obtained an estimate of how well our model performs on unseen data. So, there
is no reason for with-holding the test set from the algorithm any longer. Since we assume that our
samples are i.i.d., there is no reason to assume the model would perform worse after feeding it all the
available data. As a rule of thumb, the model will have a better generalization performance if the
algorithms uses more informative data – assuming that it has not reached its capacity, yet.
9
1.6 Pessimistic Bias
Section 1.3 (Resubstitution Validation and the Holdout Method) referenced two types of problems
that occur when a dataset is split into separate training and test sets. The ﬁrst problem that occurs is
the violation of independence and the changing class proportions upon subsampling (discussed in
Section 1.4). Walking through the holdout validation method (Section 1.5) touched upon a second
problem we encounter upon subsampling a dataset: Step 4 mentioned capacity of a model, and
whether additional data could be useful or not. To follow up on the capacity issue: If a model has
not reached its capacity, the performance estimate would be pessimistically biased. This assumes
that the algorithm could learn a better model if it was given more data – by splitting off a portion of
the dataset for testing, we withhold valuable data for estimating the generalization performance (for
instance, the test dataset). To address this issue, one might ﬁt the model to the whole dataset after
estimating the generalization performance (see Figure 2 step 4). However, using this approach, we
cannot estimate its generalization performance of the reﬁt model, since we have now "burned" the
test dataset. It is a dilemma that we cannot really avoid in real-world application, but we should be
aware that our estimate of the generalization performance may be pessimistically biased if only a
portion of the dataset, the training dataset, is used for model ﬁtting (this is especially affects models
ﬁt to relatively small datasets).
1.7 Conﬁdence Intervals via Normal Approximation
Using the holdout method as described in Section 1.5, we computed a point estimate of the gener-
alization performance of a model. Certainly, a conﬁdence interval around this estimate would not
only be more informative and desirable in certain applications, but our point estimate could be quite
sensitive to the particular training/test split (for instance, suffering from high variance). A simple
approach for computing conﬁdence intervals of the predictive accuracy or error of a model is via the
so-called normal approximation. Here, we assume that the predictions follow a normal distribution,
to compute the conﬁdence interval on the mean on a single training-test split under the central limit
theorem. The following text illustrates how this works.
As discussed earlier, we compute the prediction accuracy on a datasetS (here: test set) of sizen as
follows:
ACCS = 1
n
n∑
i=1
δ(L( ˆyi,yi)), (10)
whereL(·) is the 0-1 loss function (Equation 3), and n denotes the number of samples in the test
dataset. Further, let ˆyi be the predicted class label andyi be the ground truth class label of theith test
example, respectively. So, we could now consider each prediction as a Bernoulli trial, and the number
of correct predictions X is following a binomial distribution X∼ (n,p ) withn test examples,k
trials, and the probability of successp, wheren∈ N andp∈ [0, 1] :
f(k;n,p ) = Pr(X =k) =
(n
k
)
pk(1−p)n−k, (11)
fork = 0, 1, 2,...,n , where
(n
k
)
= n!
k!(n−k)!. (12)
(Here,p is the probability of success, and consequently,(1−p) is the probability of failure – a wrong
prediction.)
Now, the expected number of successes is computed asµ =np, or more concretely, if the model has
a 50% success rate, we expect 20 out of 40 predictions to be correct. The estimate has a variance of
σ2 =np(1−p) = 10 (13)
10
and a standard deviation of
σ =
√
np(1−p) = 3.16. (14)
Since we are interested in the average number of successes, not its absolute value, we compute the
variance of the accuracy estimate as
σ2 = 1
nACCS(1−ACCS), (15)
and the respective standard deviation as
σ =
√
1
nACCS(1−ACCS). (16)
Under the normal approximation, we can then compute the conﬁdence interval as
ACCS±z
√
1
nACCS (1−ACCS), (17)
whereα is the error quantile and z is the 1− α
2 quantile of a standard normal distribution. For a
typical conﬁdence interval of 95%, (α = 0.05), we havez = 1.96.
In practice, however, I would rather recommend repeating the training-test split multiple times to
compute the conﬁdence interval on the mean estimate (for instance, averaging the individual runs).
In any case, one interesting take-away for now is that having fewer samples in the test set increases
the variance (seen in the denominator above) and thus widens the conﬁdence interval. Conﬁdence
intervals and estimating uncertainty will be discussed in more detail in the next section, Section 2.
2 Bootstrapping and Uncertainties
2.1 Overview
The previous section (Section 1, Introduction: Essential Model Evaluation Terms and Techniques)
introduced the general ideas behind model evaluation in supervised machine learning. We discussed
the holdout method, which helps us to deal with real world limitations such as limited access to new,
labeled data for model evaluation. Using the holdout method, we split our dataset into two parts: A
training and a test set. First, we provide the training data to a supervised learning algorithm. The
learning algorithm builds a model from the training set of labeled observations. Then, we evaluate the
predictive performance of the model on an independent test set that shall represent new, unseen data.
Also, we brieﬂy introduced the normal approximation, which requires us to make certain assumptions
that allow us to compute conﬁdence intervals for modeling the uncertainty of our performance
estimate based on a single test set, which we have to take with a grain of salt.
This section introduces some of the advanced techniques for model evaluation. We will start by
discussing techniques for estimating the uncertainty of our estimated model performance as well
as the model’s variance and stability. And after getting these basics under our belt, we will look at
cross-validation techniques for model selection in the next article in this series. As we remember from
Section 1, there are three related, yet different tasks or reasons why we care about model evaluation:
1. We want to estimate the generalization accuracy, the predictive performance of a model on
future (unseen) data.
2. We want to increase the predictive performance by tweaking the learning algorithm and
selecting the best-performing model from a given hypothesis space.
3. We want to identify the machine learning algorithm that is best-suited for the problem at
hand. Hence, we want to compare different algorithms, selecting the best-performing one as
well as the best-performing model from the algorithm’s hypothesis space.

2.2 Resampling
The ﬁrst section of this article introduced the prediction accuracy or error measures of classiﬁcation
models. To compute the classiﬁcation error or accuracy on a dataset S, we deﬁned the following
equation:
ERRS = 1
n
n∑
i=1
L
(
ˆyi,yi
)
= 1− ACCS. (18)
Here,L(·) represents the 0-1 loss, which is computed from a predicted class label ( ˆyi) and a true
class label (yi) fori = 1,...,n in datasetS:
L( ˆyi,yi) =



0 if ˆyi =yi
1 if ˆyi̸=yi.
(19)
In essence, the classiﬁcation error is simply the count of incorrect predictions divided by the number
of samples in the dataset. Vice versa, we compute the prediction accuracy as the number of correct
predictions divided by the number of samples.
Note that the concepts presented in this section also apply to other types of supervised learning,
such as regression analysis. To use the resampling methods presented in the following sections for
regression models, we swap the accuracy or error computation by, for example, the mean squared
error (MSE):
MSES = 1
n
n∑
i=1
(ˆyi−yi)2. (20)
As discussed in Section 1, performance estimates may suffer from bias and variance, and we are
interested in ﬁnding a good trade-off. For instance, the resubstitution evaluation (ﬁtting a model to
a training set and using the same training set for model evaluation) is heavily optimistically biased.
Vice versa, withholding a large portion of the dataset as a test set may lead to pessimistically biased
estimates. While reducing the size of the test set may decrease this pessimistic bias, the variance of a
performance estimates will most likely increase. An intuitive illustration of the relationship between
bias and variance is given in Figure 3. This section will introduce alternative resampling methods for
ﬁnding a good balance between bias and variance for model evaluation and selection.
The reason why a proportionally large test sets increase the pessimistic bias is that the model may
not have reached its full capacity, yet. In other words, the learning algorithm could have formulated
a more powerful, more generalizable hypothesis for classiﬁcation if it had seen more data. To
demonstrate this effect, Figure 4 shows learning curves of a softmax classiﬁers, which were ﬁtted to
small subsets of the MNIST5 dataset.
To generate the learning curves shown in Figure 4, 500 random samples of each of the ten classes
from MNIST – instances of the handwritten digits 0 to 9 – were drawn. The 5000-sample MNIST
subset was then randomly divided into a 3500-sample training subset and a test set containing 1500
samples while keeping the class proportions intact via stratiﬁcation. Finally, even smaller subsets
of the 3500-sample training set were produced via randomized, stratiﬁed splits, and these subsets
were used to ﬁt softmax classiﬁers and the same 1500-sample test set was used to evaluate their
performances (samples may overlap between these training subsets). Looking at the plot above, we
can see two distinct trends. First, the resubstitution accuracy (training set) declines as the number of
training samples grows. Second, we observe an improving generalization accuracy (test set) with
an increasing training set size. These trends can likely be attributed to a reduction in overﬁtting. If

the training set is small, the algorithm is more likely picking up noise in the training set so that the
model fails to generalize well to data that it has not seen before. This observation also explains the
pessimistic bias of the holdout method: A training algorithm may beneﬁt from more training data,
data that was withheld for testing. Thus, after we evaluated a model, we may want to run the learning
algorithm once again on the complete dataset before we use it in a real-world application.
Now, that we established the point of pessimistic biases for disproportionally large test sets, we may
ask whether it is a good idea to decrease the size of the test set. Decreasing the size of the test set
brings up another problem: It may result in a substantial variance of a model’s performance estimate.
The reason is that it depends on which instances end up in training set, and which particular instances
13
end up in test set. Keeping in mind that each time we resample a dataset, we alter the statistics of the
distribution of the sample. Most supervised learning algorithms for classiﬁcation and regression as
well as the performance estimates operate under the assumption that a dataset is representative of the
population that this dataset sample has been drawn from. As discussed in Section 1.4, stratiﬁcation
helps with keeping the sample proportions intact upon splitting a dataset. However, the change in the
underlying sample statistics along the features axes is still a problem that becomes more pronounced
if we work with small datasets, which is illustrated in Figure 5.

2.3 Repeated Holdout Validation
One way to obtain a more robust performance estimate that is less variant to how we split the data
into training and test sets is to repeat the holdout methodk times with different random seeds and
compute the average performance over thesek repetitions:
ACCavg = 1
k

. (22)
This repeated holdout procedure, sometimes also called Monte Carlo Cross-Validation, provides a
better estimate of how well our model may perform on a random test set, compared to the standard
holdout validation method. Also, it provides information about the model’s stability – how the model,
produced by a learning algorithm, changes with different training set splits. Figure 6 shall illustrate
how repeated holdout validation may look like for different training-test split using the Iris dataset to
ﬁt to 3-nearest neighbors classiﬁers.

Figure 6: Repeated holdout validation with 3-nearest neighbor classiﬁers ﬁt to the Iris dataset.
The left subplot in Figure 6 was generated by performing 50 stratiﬁed training/test splits with 75
samples in the test and training set each; a 3-nearest neighbors model was ﬁt to the training set and
evaluated on the test set in each repetition. The average accuracy of these 50 50/50 splits was 95%.
The same procedure was used to produce the right subplot in Figure 6. Here, the test sets consisted of
only 15 samples each due to the 90/10 splits, and the average accuracy over these 50 splits was 96%.
Figure 6 demonstrates two of the points that were previously discussed. First, we see that the variance
of our estimate increases as the size of the test set decreases. Second, we see a small increase in the
pessimistic bias when we decrease the size of the training set – we withhold more training data in the
50/50 split, which may be the reason why the average performance over the 50 splits is slightly lower
compared to the 90/10 splits.
The next section introduces an alternative method for evaluating a model’s performance; it will
discuss about different ﬂavors of the bootstrap method that are commonly used to infer the uncertainty
of a performance estimate.
2.4 The Bootstrap Method and Empirical Conﬁdence Intervals
The previous examples of Monte Carlo Cross-Validation may have convinced us that repeated holdout
validation could provide us with a more robust estimate of a model’s performance on random test
sets compared to an evaluation based on a single train/test split via holdout validation (Section
15
1.5). In addition, the repeated holdout may give us an idea about the stability of our model. This
section explores an alternative approach to model evaluation and for estimating uncertainty using the
bootstrap method.
Let us assume that we would like to compute a conﬁdence interval around a performance estimate
to judge its certainty – or uncertainty. How can we achieve this if our sample has been drawn
from an unknown distribution? Maybe we could use the sample mean as a point estimate of the
population mean, but how would we compute the variance or conﬁdence intervals around the mean if
its distribution is unknown? Sure, we could collect multiple, independent samples; this is a luxury we
often do not have in real world applications, though. Now, the idea behind the bootstrap is to generate
"new samples" by sampling from an empirical distribution. As a side note, the term "bootstrap" likely
originated from the phrase "to pull oneself up by one’s bootstraps:"
Circa 1900, to pull (oneself) up by (one’s) bootstraps was used ﬁguratively of
an impossible task (Among the "practical questions" at the end of chapter one of
Steele’s "Popular Physics" schoolbook (1888) is "Why can not a man lift himself
by pulling up on his boot-straps?". By 1916 its meaning expanded to include
"better oneself by rigorous, unaided effort." The meaning "ﬁxed sequence of
instructions to load the operating system of a computer" (1953) is from the notion
of the ﬁrst-loaded program pulling itself, and the rest, up by the bootstrap.
[Source: Online Etymology Dictionary6]
The bootstrap method is a resampling technique for estimating a sampling distribution, and in the
context of this article, we are particularly interested in estimating the uncertainty of a performance
estimate – the prediction accuracy or error. The bootstrap method was introduced by Bradley Efron
in 1979 [Efron, 1992]. About 15 years later, Bradley Efron and Robert Tibshirani even devoted a
whole book to the bootstrap, "An Introduction to the Bootstrap" [Efron and Tibshirani, 1994], which
is a highly recommended read for everyone who is interested in more details on this topic. In brief,
the idea of the bootstrap method is to generate new data from a population by repeated sampling from
the original dataset with replacement – in contrast, the repeated holdout method can be understood as
sampling without replacement. Walking through it step by step, the bootstrap method works like this:
1. We are given a dataset of size n.
2. For b bootstrap rounds:
We draw one single instance from this dataset and assign it to thejth bootstrap sample.
We repeat this step until our bootstrap sample has size n – the size of the original dataset.
Each time, we draw samples from the same original dataset such that certain examples may
appear more than once in a bootstrap sample and some not at all.
3. We ﬁt a model to each of the b bootstrap samples and compute the resubstitution accuracy.
4. We compute the model accuracy as the average over theb accuracy estimates (Equation 23).

(23)
As discussed previously, the resubstitution accuracy usually leads to an extremely optimistic bias,
since a model can be overly sensible to noise in a dataset. Originally, the bootstrap method aims to
determine the statistical properties of an estimator when the underlying distribution was unknown
and additional samples are not available. So, in order to exploit this method for the evaluation of
predictive models, such as hypotheses for classiﬁcation and regression, we may prefer a slightly
different approach to bootstrapping using the so-called Leave-One-Out Bootstrap (LOOB) technique.
Here, we use out-of-bag samples as test sets for evaluation instead of evaluating the model on the
training data. Out-of-bag samples are the unique sets of instances that are not used for model ﬁtting
as shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7 illustrates how three random bootstrap samples drawn from an exemplary ten-sample dataset
(x1,x 2,...,x 10) and how the out-of-bag sample might look like. In practice, Bradley Efron and

Robert Tibshirani recommend drawing 50 to 200 bootstrap samples as being sufﬁcient for producing
reliable estimates [Efron and Tibshirani, 1994].
Taking a step back, let us assume that a sample that has been drawn from a normal distribution. Using
basic concepts from statistics, we use the sample mean ¯x as a point estimate of the population mean
µ:
¯x = 1
n
n∑
i=1
xi. (24)
Similarly, the varianceσ2 is estimated as follows:
V AR= 1
n− 1
n∑
i=1
(xi− ¯x)2. (25)
Consequently, the standard error (SE) is computed as the standard deviation’s estimate ( SD≈ σ)
divided by the square root of the sample size:
SE = SD√n. (26)
Using the standard error we can then compute a 95% conﬁdence interval of the mean according to
¯x±z× σ√n, (27)
such that
¯x±t× SE, (28)
withz = 1.96 for the 95 % conﬁdence interval. Since SD is the standard deviation of the population
(σ) estimated from the sample, we have to consult at-table to look up the actual value oft, which
depends on the size of the sample – or the degrees of freedom to be precise. For instance, given a
sample withn = 100, we ﬁnd thatt95 = 1.984.
17
Similarly, we can compute the 95% conﬁdence interval of the bootstrap estimate starting with the
mean accuracy,
ACCboot = 1
b
b∑
i=1
ACCi, (29)
and use it to compute the standard error
SEboot =
√ 1
b− 1
b∑
i=1
(ACCi− ACCboot)2. (30)
Here, ACCi is the value of the statistic (the estimate ofACC ) calculated on theith bootstrap replicate.
And the standard deviation of the values ACC1, ACC1,..., ACCb is the estimate of the standard error
of ACC [Efron and Tibshirani, 1994].
Finally, we can then compute the conﬁdence interval around the mean estimate as
ACCboot±t× SEboot. (31)
Although the approach outlined above seems intuitive, what can we do if our samples do not follow a
normal distribution? A more robust, yet computationally straight-forward approach is the percentile
method as described by B. Efron [Efron, 1981]. Here, we pick the lower and upper conﬁdence bounds
as follows:
• ACClower =α1th percentile of the ACCboot distribution
• ACCupper =α2th percentile of the ACCboot distribution,
whereα1 =α andα2 = 1−α, andα is the degree of conﬁdence for computing the100×(1−2×α)
conﬁdence interval. For instance, to compute a 95% conﬁdence interval, we pickα = 0.025 to obtain
the the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of theb bootstrap samples distribution as our upper and lower
conﬁdence bounds.
In practice, if the data is indeed (roughly) following a normal distribution, the "standard" conﬁdence
interval and percentile method typically agree as illustrated in the Figure 8.

sublpanel B shows the results of softmax regression models on MNIST.
In 1983, Bradley Efron described the .632 Estimate, a further improvement to address the pessimistic
bias of the bootstrap cross-validation approach described above [Efron, 1983]. The pessimistic bias
in the "classic" bootstrap method can be attributed to the fact that the bootstrap samples only contain
approximately 63.2% of the unique examples from the original dataset. For instance, we can compute
18
the probability that a given example from a dataset of sizen is not drawn as a bootstrap sample as
follows:
P (not chosen) =
(
1− 1
n
)n
, (32)
which is asymptotically equivalent to 1
e≈ 0.368 asn→∞ .
Vice versa, we can then compute the probability that a sample is chosen as
P (chosen) = 1−
(
1− 1
n
)n
≈ 0.632 (33)
for reasonably large datasets, so that we select approximately0.632×n unique examples as bootstrap
training sets and reserve 0.382×n out-of-bag examples for testing in each iteration, which is
illustrated in Figure 9.
Figure 9: Probability of including an example from the dataset in a bootstrap sample for different
dataset sizesn.
Now, to address the bias that is due to this the sampling with replacement, Bradley Efron proposed
the .632 Estimate mentioned earlier, which is computed via the following equation:
ACCboot = 1
b
b∑
i=1
(
0.632· ACCh,i + 0.368· ACCr,i
)
, (34)
where ACCr,i is the resubstitution accuracy, and ACCh,i is the accuracy on the out-of-bag sample.
Now, while the .632 Boostrap attempts to address the pessimistic bias of the estimate, an optimistic
bias may occur with models that tend to overﬁt so that Bradley Efron and Robert Tibshirani proposed
The .632+ Bootstrap Method[Efron and Tibshirani, 1997]. Instead of using a ﬁxed weightω = 0.632
in
ACCboot = 1
b
b∑
i=1
(
ω· ACCh,i + (1−ω)· ACCr,i

, (35)
19
we compute the weightω as
ω = 0.632
1− 0.368×R, (36)
where R is the relative overﬁtting rate:
R = (−1)× (ACCh,i− ACCr,i)
γ− (1− ACCh,i) . (37)
(Since we are pluggingω into Equation 35 for computing ACCboot that we deﬁned above, ACCh,i
and ACCr,i still refer to the resubstitution and out-of-bag accuracy estimates in the ith bootstrap
round, respectively.)
Further, we need to determine the no-information rateγ in order to computeR. For instance, we can
computeγ by ﬁtting a model to a dataset that contains all possible combinations between samplesx′
i
and target class labelsyi – we pretend that the observations and class labels are independent:
γ = 1

L(yi,f (xi′)). (38)
Alternatively, we can estimate the no-information rateγ as follows:
γ =
K∑
k=1
pk(1−qk), (39)
wherepk is the proportion of classk examples observed in the dataset, andqk is the proportion of
classk examples that the classiﬁer predicts in the dataset.
The OOB bootstrap, 0.632 bootstrap, and .632+ boostrap method discussed in this section are
implemented in MLxtend [Raschka, 2018] to enable comparison studies.7
This section continued the discussion around biases and variances in evaluating machine learning
models in more detail. Further, it introduced the repeated hold-out method that may provide us with
some further insights into a model’s stability. Then, we looked at the bootstrap method and explored
different ﬂavors of this bootstrap method that help us estimate the uncertainty of our performance
estimates. After covering the basics of model evaluation in this and the previous section, the next
section introduces hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
3 Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Optimization
3.1 Overview
Almost every machine learning algorithm comes with a large number of settings that we, the
machine learning researchers and practitioners, need to specify. These tuning knobs, the so-called
hyperparameters, help us control the behavior of machine learning algorithms when optimizing
for performance, ﬁnding the right balance between bias and variance. Hyperparameter tuning for
performance optimization is an art in itself, and there are no hard-and-fast rules that guarantee best
performance on a given dataset. The previous sections covered holdout and bootstrap techniques for
estimating the generalization performance of a model. The bias-variance trade-off was discussed in the
context of estimating the generalization performance as well as methods for computing the uncertainty
of performance estimates. This third section focusses on different methods of cross-validation for
model evaluation and model selection. It covers cross-validation techniques to rank models from
several hyperparameter conﬁgurations and estimate how well these generalize to independent datasets.

3.2 About Hyperparameters and Model Selection
Previously, the holdout method and different ﬂavors of the bootstrap were introduced to estimate
the generalization performance of our predictive models. We split the dataset into two parts: a
training and a test dataset. After the machine learning algorithm ﬁt a model to the training set, we
evaluated it on the independent test set that we withheld from the machine learning algorithm during
model ﬁtting. While we were discussing challenges such as the bias-variance trade-off, we used
ﬁxed hyperparameter settings in our learning algorithms, such as the number ofk in thek-nearest
neighbors algorithm. We deﬁned hyperparameters as the parameters of the learning algorithm itself,
which we have to specify a priori – before model ﬁtting. In contrast, we referred to the parameters of
our resulting model as the model parameters.
So, what are hyperparameters, exactly? Considering thek-nearest neighbors algorithm, one example
of a hyperparameter is the integer value ofk (Figure 10). If we setk = 3, thek-nearest neighbors
algorithm will predict a class label based on a majority vote among the 3-nearest neighbors in the
training set. The distance metric for ﬁnding these nearest neighbors is yet another hyperparameter of
this algorithm.
?
k = 5
k = 3
k = 1
feature 1
feature 2
Figure 10: Illustration of thek-nearest neighbors algorithm with different choices fork.
Now, thek-nearest neighbors algorithm may not be an ideal choice for illustrating the difference
between hyperparameters and model parameters, since it is alazy learner and a nonparametric method.
In this context, lazy learning (or instance-based learning) means that there is no training or model
ﬁtting stage: Ak-nearest neighbors model literally stores or memorizes the training data and uses it
only at prediction time. Thus, each training instance represents a parameter in thek-nearest neighbors
model. In short, nonparametric models are models that cannot be described by a ﬁxed number of
parameters that are being adjusted to the training set. The structure of parametric models is not
decided by the training data rather than being seta priori; nonparamtric models do not assume that the
data follows certain probability distributions unlike parametric methods (exceptions of nonparametric
methods that make such assumptions are Bayesian nonparametric methods). Hence, we may say that
nonparametric methods make fewer assumptions about the data than parametric methods.
In contrast tok-nearest neighbors, a simple example of a parametric method is logistic regression,
a generalized linear model with a ﬁxed number of model parameters: a weight coefﬁcient for each
feature variable in the dataset plus a bias (or intercept) unit. These weight coefﬁcients in logistic
21
regression, the model parameters, are updated by maximizing a log-likelihood function or minimizing
the logistic cost. For ﬁtting a model to the training data, a hyperparameter of a logistic regression
algorithm could be the number of iterations or passes over the training set (epochs) in gradient-based
optimization. Another example of a hyperparameter would be the value of a regularization parameter
such as the lambda-term in L2-regularized logistic regression (Figure 11).
Figure 11: Conceptual overview of logistic regression.
Changing the hyperparameter values when running a learning algorithm over a training set may result
in different models. The process of ﬁnding the best-performing model from a set of models that were
produced by different hyperparameter settings is called model selection. The next section introduces
an extension to the holdout method that is useful when carrying out this selection process.
3.3 The Three-Way Holdout Method for Hyperparameter Tuning
Section 1 provided an explanation why resubstitution validation is a bad approach for estimating of
the generalization performance. Since we want to know how well our model generalizes to new data,
we used the holdout method to split the dataset into two parts, a training set and an independent test
set. Can we use the holdout method for hyperparameter tuning? The answer is "yes." However, we
have to make a slight modiﬁcation to our initial approach, the "two-way" split, and split the dataset
into three parts: a training, a validation, and a test set.
The process of hyperparameter tuning (or hyperparameter optimization) and model selection can be
regarded as a meta-optimization task. While the learning algorithm optimizes an objective function
on the training set (with exception to lazy learners), hyperparameter optimization is yet another
task on top of it; here, we typically want to optimize a performance metric such as classiﬁcation
accuracy or the area under a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. After the tuning stage, selecting
a model based on the test set performance seems to be a reasonable approach. However, reusing the
test set multiple times would introduce a bias and the ﬁnal performance estimate and likely result
in overly optimistic estimates of the generalization performance – one might say that "the test set
leaks information." To avoid this problem, we could use a three-way split, dividing the dataset into a
training, validation, and test dataset. Having a training-validation pair for hyperparameter tuning and
model selections allows us to keep the test set "independent" for model evaluation. Once more, let us
recall the "3 goals" of performance estimation:
22
1. We want to estimate the generalization accuracy, the predictive performance of a model on
future (unseen) data.
2. We want to increase the predictive performance by tweaking the learning algorithm and
selecting the best-performing model from a given hypothesis space.
3. We want to identify the machine learning algorithm that is best-suited for the problem at
hand; thus, we want to compare different algorithms, selecting the best-performing one as
well as the best-performing model from the algorithm’s hypothesis space.
The "three-way holdout method" is one way to tackle points 1 and 2 (more on point 3 in Section
4). Though, if we are only interested in point 2, selecting the best model, and do not care so much
about an "unbiased" estimate of the generalization performance, we could stick to the two-way split
for model selection. Thinking back of our discussion about learning curves and pessimistic biases
in Section 2, we noted that a machine learning algorithm often beneﬁts from more labeled data;
the smaller the dataset, the higher the pessimistic bias and the variance – the sensitivity of a model
towards the data is partitioned.
"There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch." The three-way holdout method for hyperparameter tuning
and model selection is not the only – and certainly often not the best – way to approach this task. Later
sections, will introduce alternative methods and discuss their advantages and trade-offs. However,
before we move on to the probably most popular method for model selection,k-fold cross-validation
(or sometimes also called "rotation estimation" in older literature), let us have a look at an illustration
of the 3-way split holdout method in Figure 12.
Let us walk through Figure 12 step by step.
Step 1. We start by splitting our dataset into three parts, a training set for model ﬁtting, a validation
set for model selection, and a test set for the ﬁnal evaluation of the selected model.
Step 2. This step illustrates the hyperparameter tuning stage. We use the learning algorithm with
different hyperparameter settings (here: three) to ﬁt models to the training data.
Step 3. Next, we evaluate the performance of our models on the validation set. This step illustrates
the model selection stage; after comparing the performance estimates, we choose the hyperparameters
settings associated with the best performance. Note that we often merge steps two and three in
practice: we ﬁt a model and compute its performance before moving on to the next model in order to
avoid keeping all ﬁtted models in memory.
Step 4. As discussed earlier, the performance estimates may suffer from pessimistic bias if the
training set is too small. Thus, we can merge the training and validation set after model selection and
use the best hyperparameter settings from the previous step to ﬁt a model to this larger dataset.
Step 5. Now, we can use the independent test set to estimate the generalization performance our
model. Remember that the purpose of the test set is to simulate new data that the model has not
seen before. Re-using this test set may result in an overoptimistic bias in our estimate of the model’s
generalization performance.
Step 6. Finally, we can make use of all our data – merging training and test set– and ﬁt a model to
all data points for real-world use.
Note that ﬁtting the model on all available data might yield a model that is likely slightly different
from the model evaluated in Step 5. However, in theory, using all data (that is, training and test
data) to ﬁt the model should only improve its performance. Under this assumption, the evaluated
performance from Step 5 might slightly underestimate the performance of the model ﬁtted in Step
6. (If we use test data for ﬁtting, we do not have data left to evaluate the model, unless we collect
new data.) In real-world applications, having the "best possible" model is often desired – or in other
words, we do not mind if we slightly underestimated its performance. In any case, we can regard this
sixth step as optional.

3.4 Introduction to k-fold Cross-Validation
It is about time to introduce the probably most common technique for model evaluation and model
selection in machine learning practice: k-fold cross-validation. The term cross-validation is used
loosely in literature, where practitioners and researchers sometimes refer to the train/test holdout
method as a cross-validation technique. However, it might make more sense to think of cross-
24
validation as a crossing over of training and validation stages in successive rounds. Here, the main
idea behind cross-validation is that each sample in our dataset has the opportunity of being tested.
k-fold cross-validation is a special case of cross-validation where we iterate over a dataset setk times.
In each round, we split the dataset into k parts: one part is used for validation, and the remaining
k− 1 parts are merged into a training subset for model evaluation as shown in Figure 13 , which
illustrates the process of 5-fold cross-validation.

Figure 13: Illustration of thek-fold cross-validation procedure.
Just as in the "two-way" holdout method (Section 1.5), we use a learning algorithm with ﬁxed
hyperparameter settings to ﬁt models to the training folds in each iteration when we use thek-fold
cross-validation method for model evaluation. In 5-fold cross-validation, this procedure will result
in ﬁve different models ﬁtted; these models were ﬁt to distinct yet partly overlapping training sets
and evaluated on non-overlapping validation sets. Eventually, we compute the cross-validation
performance as the arithmetic mean over thek performance estimates from the validation sets.
We saw the main difference between the "two-way" holdout method and k-fold cross validation:
k-fold cross-validation uses all data for training and testing. The idea behind this approach is to reduce
the pessimistic bias by using more training data in contrast to setting aside a relatively large portion
of the dataset as test data. And in contrast to the repeated holdout method, which was discussed in
Section 2, test folds ink-fold cross-validation are not overlapping. In repeated holdout, the repeated
use of samples for testing results in performance estimates that become dependent between rounds;
25
this dependence can be problematic for statistical comparisons, which we will be discussed in Section
4. Also,k-fold cross-validation guarantees that each sample is used for validation in contrast to the
repeated holdout-method, where some samples may never be part of the test set.
This section introducedk-fold cross-validation for model evaluation. In practice, however,k-fold
cross-validation is more commonly used for model selection or algorithm selection. k-fold cross-
validation for model selection is a topic that we will be covered in the next sections, and algorithm
selection will be discussed in detail throughout Section 4.
3.5 Special Cases: 2-Fold and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
At this point, you may wonder why k = 5 was chosen to illustrate k-fold cross-validation in the
previous section. One reason is that it makes it easier to illustratek-fold cross-validation compactly.
Moreover,k = 5 is also a common choice in practice, since it is computationally less expensive
compared to larger values of k. If k is too small, though, the pessimistic bias of the performance
estimate may increase (since less training data is available for model ﬁtting), and the variance of the
estimate may increase as well since the model is more sensitive to how the data was split (in the next
sections, experiments will be discussed that suggestk = 10 as a good choice fork).
In fact, there are two prominent, special cases of k-fold cross validation: k = 2 andk =n. Most
literature describes 2-fold cross-validation as being equal to the holdout method. However, this
statement would only be true if we performed the holdout method by rotating the training and
validation set in two rounds (for instance, using exactly 50% data for training and 50% of the
examples for validation in each round, swapping these sets, repeating the training and evaluation
procedure, and eventually computing the performance estimate as the arithmetic mean of the two
performance estimates on the validation sets). Given how the holdout method is most commonly
used though, this article describes the holdout method and 2-fold cross-validation as two different
processes as illustrated in Figure 14.
Now, if we set k = n, that is, if we set the number of folds as being equal to the number of
training instances, we refer to thek-fold cross-validation process as Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
(LOOCV), which is illustrated in Figure 15. In each iteration during LOOCV , we ﬁt a model ton− 1
samples of the dataset and evaluate it on the single, remaining data point. Although this process is
computationally expensive, given that we haven iterations, it can be useful for small datasets, cases
where withholding data from the training set would be too wasteful.
Several studies compared different values ofk ink-fold cross-validation, analyzing how the choice
ofk affects the variance and the bias of the estimate. Unfortunately, there is no Free Lunch though as
shown by Yohsua Bengio and Yves Grandvalet in "No unbiased estimator of the variance ofk-fold
cross-validation:"
The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions)
unbiased estimator of the variance ofk-fold cross-validation.
[Bengio and Grandvalet, 2004]
However, we may still be interested in ﬁnding a "sweet spot," a value fork that seems to be a good
trade-off between variance and bias in most cases, and the bias-variance trade-off discussion will
be continued in the next section. For now, let us conclude this section by looking at an interesting
research project where Hawkins and others compared performance estimates via LOOCV to the
holdout method and recommend the LOOCV over the latter – if computationally feasible:
[...] where available sample sizes are modest, holding back compounds for model
testing is ill-advised. This fragmentation of the sample harms the calibration and
does not give a trustworthy assessment of ﬁt anyway. It is better to use all data
for the calibration step and check the ﬁt by cross-validation, making sure that
the cross-validation is carried out correctly. [...] The only motivation to rely on
the holdout sample rather than cross-validation would be if there was reason to
think the cross-validation not trustworthy – biased or highly variable. But neither
theoretical results nor the empiric results sketched here give any reason to disbelieve
the cross-validation results.

The conclusions in the previous quotation are partly based on the experiments carried out in this study
using a 469-sample dataset, and Table 1 summarizes the ﬁndings in a comparison of different Ridge
Regression models evaluated by LOOCV and the holdout method [Hawkins et al., 2003]. The ﬁrst
row corresponds to an experiment where the researchers used LOOCV to ﬁt regression models to
100-example training subsets. The reported "mean" refers to the averaged difference between the true
coefﬁcients of determination (R2) and the coefﬁcients obtained via LOOCV (here calledq2) after
repeating this procedure on different 100-example training sets and averaging the results. In rows
2-4, the researchers used the holdout method for ﬁtting models to the 100-example training sets, and
they evaluated the performances on holdout sets of sizes 10, 20, and 50 samples. Each experiment
was repeated 75 times, and the mean column shows the average difference between the estimatedR2
and the trueR2 values. As we can see, the estimates obtained via LOOCV (q2) are the closest to the
trueR2 on average. The estimates obtained from the 50-example test set via the holdout method are
also passable, though. Based on these particular experiments, we may agree with the researchers’
conclusion:

Taking the third of these points, if you have 150 or more compounds available,
then you can certainly make a random split into 100 for calibration and 50 or more
for testing. However it is hard to see why you would want to do this.
[Hawkins et al., 2003]
One reason why we may prefer the holdout method may be concerns about computational efﬁciency,
if the dataset is sufﬁciently large. As a rule of thumb, we can say that the pessimistic bias and large
variance concerns are less problematic the larger the dataset. Moreover, it is not uncommon to repeat
thek-fold cross-validation procedure with different random seeds in hope to obtain a "more robust"
estimate. For instance, if we repeated a 5-fold cross-validation run 100 times, we would compute
the performance estimate for 500 test folds report the cross-validation performance as the arithmetic
mean of these 500 folds. (Although this is commonly done in practice, we note that the test folds are
now overlapping.) However, there is no point in repeating LOOCV , since LOOCV always produces
the same splits.
3.6 k-fold Cross-Validation and the Bias-Variance Trade-off
Based on the study by Hawkins and others [Hawkins et al., 2003] discussed in Section 3.5 we may
prefer LOOCV over single train/test splits via the holdout method for small and moderately sized
datasets. In addition, we can think of the LOOCV estimate as being approximately unbiased: the
pessimistic bias of LOOCV (k =n) is intuitively lower comparedk <n-fold cross-validation, since
almost all (for instance,n− 1) training samples are available for model ﬁtting.
While LOOCV is almost unbiased, one downside of using LOOCV over k-fold cross-validation
withk < nis the large variance of the LOOCV estimate. First, we have to note that LOOCV is
defect when using a discontinuous loss-function such as the 0-1 loss in classiﬁcation or even in
continuous loss functions such as the mean-squared-error. It is said that LOOCV "[LOOCV has] high
variance because the test set only contains one sample" [Tan et al., 2005] and "[LOOCV] is highly
variable, since it is based upon a single observation (x1, y1)" [James et al., 2013]. These statements
are certainly true if we refer to the variance between folds. Remember that if we use the 0-1 loss
28
function (the prediction is either correct or not), we could consider each prediction as a Bernoulli
trial, and the number of correct predictions X if following a binomial distribution X≈ B(n,p ),
wheren∈ N andp∈ [0, 1]; the variance of a binomial distribution is deﬁned as
σ2 =np(1−p) (40)
We can estimate the variability of a statistic (here: the performance of the model) from the variability
of that statistic between subsamples. Obviously though, the variance between folds is a poor estimate
of the variance of the LOOCV estimate – the variability due to randomness in our training data. Now,
when we are talking about the variance of LOOCV , we typically mean the difference in the results
that we would get if we repeated the resampling procedure multiple times on different data samples
from the underlying distribution. In this context interesting point has been made by Hastie, Tibshirani,
and Friedman:
Withk =n, the cross-validation estimator is approximately unbiased for the true
(expected) prediction error, but can have high variance because then "training sets"
are so similar to one another.
[Hastie et al., 2009]
Or in other words, we can attribute the high variance to the well-known fact that the mean of highly
correlated variables has a higher variance than the mean of variables that are not highly correlated.
Maybe, this can intuitively be explained by looking at the relationship between covariance (cov) and
variance (σ2):
covX,X =σ2
X. (41)
or
covX,X =E
[
(X−µ)2]
=σ2
X (42)
if we letµ =E(X).
And the relationship between covariancecovX,Y and correlationρX,Y (X and Y are random variables)
is deﬁned as
covX,Y =ρX,Y σXσY, (43)
where
covX,Y =E[(X−µX)(Y−µY )] (44)
and
ρX,Y =E[(X−µX)(Y−µY )]/(σXσY ). (45)
The large variance that is often associated with LOOCV has also been observed in empirical studies
[Kohavi, 1995].
Now that we established that LOOCV estimates are generally associated with a large variance and a
small bias, how does this method compare tok-fold cross-validation with other choices fork and the
bootstrap method? Section 2 discussed the pessimistic bias of the standard bootstrap method, where
the training set asymptotically (only) contains 0.632 of the samples from the original dataset; 2- or
3-fold cross-validation has about the same problem (the .632 bootstrap that was designed to address
this pessimistic bias issue). However, Kohavi also observed in his experiments [Kohavi, 1995] that
the bias in bootstrap was still extremely large for certain real-world datasets (now, optimistically
biased) compared tok-fold cross-validation. Eventually, Kohavi’s experiments on various real-world
datasets suggest that 10-fold cross-validation offers the best trade-off between bias and variance.
29
Furthermore, other researchers found that repeatingk-fold cross-validation can increase the precision
of the estimates while still maintaining a small bias [Molinaro et al., 2005, Kim, 2009].
Before moving on to model selection in the next section, the following points shall summarize the
discussion of the bias-variance trade-off, by listing the general trends when increasing the number of
folds ork:
• The bias of the performance estimator decreases (more accurate)
• The variance of the performance estimators increases (more variability)
• The computational cost increases (more iterations, larger training sets during ﬁtting)
• Exception: decreasing the value ofk ink-fold cross-validation to small values (for example,
2 or 3) also increases the variance on small datasets due to random sampling effects.
3.7 Model Selection via k-fold Cross-Validation
Previous sections introducedk-fold cross-validation for modelevaluation. Now, this section discusses
how to use thek-fold cross-validation method for model selection. Again, the key idea is to keep
an independent test dataset, that we withhold from during training and model selection, to avoid the
leaking of test data in the training stage. This procedure is outlined in Figure 16.
Although Figure 16 might seem complicated at ﬁrst, the process is quite simple and analogous to
the "three-way holdout" workﬂow that we discussed at the beginning of this article. The following
paragraphs will discuss Figure 16 step by step.
Step 1. Similar to the holdout method, we split the dataset into two parts, a training and an
independent test set; we tuck away the test set for the ﬁnal model evaluation step at the end (Step 4).
Step 2. In this second step, we can now experiment with various hyperparameter settings; we could
use Bayesian optimization, randomized search, or grid search, for example. For each hyperparameter
conﬁguration, we apply thek-fold cross-validation method on the training set, resulting in multiple
models and performance estimates.
Step 3. Taking the hyperparameter settings that produced the best results in the k-fold cross-
validation procedure, we can then use the complete training set for model ﬁtting with these settings.
Step 4. Now, we use the independent test set that we withheld earlier (Step 1); we use this test set
to evaluate the model that we obtained from Step 3.
Step 5. Finally, after we completed the evaluation stage, we can optionally ﬁt a model to all data
(training and test datasets combined), which could be the model for (the so-called) deployment.
3.8 A Note About Model Selection and Large Datasets
When we browse the deep learning literature, we often ﬁnd that that the 3-way holdout method is
the method of choice when it comes to model evaluation; it is also common in older (non-deep
learning literature) as well. As mentioned earlier, the three-way holdout may be preferred overk-fold
cross-validation since the former is computationally cheap in comparison. Aside from computational
efﬁciency concerns, we only use deep learning algorithms when we have relatively large sample
sizes anyway, scenarios where we do not have to worry about high variance – the sensitivity of our
estimates towards how we split the dataset for training, validation, and testing – so much. Thus, it is
ﬁne to use the holdout method with a training, validation, and test split over thek-fold cross-validation
for model selection if the dataset is relatively large.
3.9 A Note About Feature Selection During Model Selection
Note that if we normalize data or select features, we typically perform these operations inside the
k-fold cross-validation loop in contrast to applying these steps to the whole dataset upfront before
splitting the data into folds. Feature selection inside the cross-validation loop reduces the bias through

overﬁtting, since it avoids peaking at the test data information during the training stage. However,
feature selection inside the cross-validation loop may lead to an overly pessimistic estimate, since
less data is available for training. A more detailed discussion on this topic, whether to perform feature
selection inside or outside the cross-validation loop, can be found in Refaeilzadeh’s "On comparison
of feature selection algorithms" [Refaeilzadeh et al., 2007].
31
3.10 The Law of Parsimony
Now that we discussed model selection in the previous section, let us take a moment and consider the
Law of Parsimony, which is also known as Occam’s Razor: "Among competing hypotheses, the one
with the fewest assumptions should be selected." In model selection practice, Occam’s razor can be
applied, for example, by using the one-standard error method [Breiman et al., 1984] as follows:
1. Consider the numerically optimal estimate and its standard error.
2. Select the model whose performance is within one standard error of the value obtained in
step 1.
Although, we may prefer simpler models for several reasons, Pedro Domingos made a good point
regarding the performance of "complex" models. Here is an excerpt from his article, "Ten Myths
About Machine Learning9:"
Simpler models are more accurate. This belief is sometimes equated with Occam’s
razor, but the razor only says that simpler explanations are preferable, not why.
They’re preferable because they’re easier to understand, remember, and reason
with. Sometimes the simplest hypothesis consistent with the data is less accurate
for prediction than a more complicated one. Some of the most powerful learning
algorithms output models that seem gratuitously elaborate? – sometimes even
continuing to add to them after they’ve perfectly ﬁt the data – but that’s how they
beat the less powerful ones.
Again, there are several reasons why we may prefer a simpler model if its performance is within a
certain, acceptable range – for example, using the one-standard error method. Although a simpler
model may not be the most "accurate" one, it may be computationally more efﬁcient, easier to
implement, and easier to understand and reason with compared to more complicated alternatives.
To see how the one-standard error method works in practice, let us consider a simple toy dataset: 300
training examples, concentric circles, and a uniform class distribution (150 samples from class 1 and
150 samples from class 2).
Figure 17: Concentric circles dataset with 210 training examples and uniform class distribution.
The concentric circles dataset is then split into two parts, 70% training data and 30% test data, using
stratiﬁcation to maintain equal class proportions. The 210 samples from the training dataset are
shown in Figure 17.

Now, let us assume that our goal is to optimize theγ (gamma) hyperparameter of a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) with a non-linear Radial Basis Function-kernel (RBF-kernel), whereγ is the free
parameter of the Gaussian RBF:
K(xi,xj) =exp(−γ||xi−xj||2),γ >0. (46)
(Intuitively, we can think ofγ as a parameter that controls the inﬂuence of single training samples on
the decision boundary.)
After running the RBF-kernel SVM algorithm with different γ values over the training set, using
stratiﬁed 10-fold cross-validation, the performance estimates shown in Figure 18 were obtained,
where the error bars are the standard errors of the cross-validation estimates.
= 0.1
= 0.001
= 10.0
Figure 18: Performance estimates and decision regions of an RBF-kernel SVM with stratiﬁed 10-fold
cross-validation for differentγ values. Error bars represent the standard error of the cross-validation
estimates.
As shown in Figure 18, Choosing γ values between 0.1 and 100 resulted in a prediction accuracy
of 80% or more. Furthermore, we can see that γ = 10.0 resulted in a fairly complex decision
boundary, and γ = 0.001 resulted in a decision boundary that is too simple to separate the two
classes in the concentric circles dataset. In fact, γ = 0.1 seems like a good trade-off between the two
aforementioned models (γ = 10.0 andγ = 0.1) – the performance of the corresponding model falls
within one standard error of the best performing model withγ = 0 orγ = 10.
3.11 Summary
There are many ways for evaluating the generalization performance of predictive models. So far,
this article covered the holdout method, different ﬂavors of the bootstrap approach, andk-fold cross-
validation. Using holdout method is absolutely ﬁne for model evaluation when working with relatively
large sample sizes. For hyperparameter optimization, we may prefer 10-fold cross-validation, and
Leave-One-Out cross-validation is a good option when working with small sample sizes. When
it comes to model selection, again, the "three-way" holdout method may be a good choice if the
33
dataset is large, if computational efﬁciency is a concern; a good alternative is using k-fold cross-
validation with an independent test set. While the previous sections focused on model evaluation
and hyperparameter optimization, Section 4 introduces different techniques for comparing different
learning algorithms.
The next section will discuss different statistical methods for comparing the performance of different
models as well as empirical approaches for comparing different machine learning algorithms.
4 Algorithm Comparison
4.1 Overview
This ﬁnal section in this article presents overviews of several statistical hypothesis testing approaches,
with applications to machine learning model and algorithm comparisons. This includes statistical
tests based on target predictions for independent test sets (the downsides of using a single test set for
model comparisons was discussed in previous sections) as well as methods for algorithm comparisons
by ﬁtting and evaluating models via cross-validation. Lastly, this ﬁnal section will introduce nested
cross-validation, which has become a common and recommended a method of choice for algorithm
comparisons for small to moderately-sized datasets.
Then, at the end of this article, I provide a list of my personal suggestions concerning model evaluation,
selection, and algorithm selection summarizing the several techniques covered in this series of articles.
4.2 Testing the Difference of Proportions
There are several different statistical hypothesis testing frameworks that are being used in practice to
compare the performance of classiﬁcation models, including conventional methods such as difference
of two proportions (here, the proportions are the estimated generalization accuracies from a test
set), for which we can construct 95% conﬁdence intervals based on the concept of the Normal
Approximation to the Binomial that was covered in Section 1.
Performing a z-score test for two population proportions is inarguably the most straight-forward way
to compare to models (but certainly not the best!): In a nutshell, if the 95% conﬁdence intervals of
the accuracies of two models do not overlap, we can reject the null hypothesis that the performance
of both classiﬁers is equal at a conﬁdence level of α = 0.05 (or 5% probability). Violations of
assumptions aside (for instance that the test set samples are not independent), as Thomas Dietterich
noted based on empirical results in a simulated study [Dietterich, 1998], this test tends to have a high
false positive rate (here: incorrectly detecting difference when there is none), which is among the
reasons why it is not recommended in practice.
Nonetheless, for the sake of completeness, and since it a commonly used method in practice, the
general procedure is outlined below as follows (which also generally applies to the different hypothesis
tests presented later):
1. formulate the hypothesis to be tested (for instance, the null hypothesis stating that the
proportions are the same; consequently, the alternative hypothesis that the proportions are
different, if we use a two-tailed test);
2. decide upon a signiﬁcance threshold (for instance, if the probability of observing a difference
more extreme than the one seen is more than 5%, then we plan to reject the null hypothesis);
3. analyze the data, compute the test statistic ( here: z-score), and compare its associated
p-value (probability) to the previously determined signiﬁcance threshold;
4. based on thep-value and signiﬁcance threshold, either accept or reject the null hypothesis at
the given conﬁdence level and interpret the results.
The z-score is computed as the observed difference divided by the square root for their combined
variances
z = ACC 1−ACC 2√
σ2
1 +σ2
2
,
34
whereACC 1 is the accuracy of one model andACC 2 is the accuracy of a second model estimated
from the test set. Recall that we computed the variance of the estimated accuracy as
σ2 = ACC (1−ACC )
n
in Section 1 and then computed the conﬁdence interval (Normal Approximation Interval) as
ACC±z×σ,
wherez = 1.96 for a 95% conﬁdence interval. Comparing the conﬁdence intervals of two accuracy
estimates and checking whether they overlap is then analogous to computing the z value for the
difference in proportions and comparing the probability (p-value) to the chosen signiﬁcance threshold.
So, to compute the z-score directly for the difference of two proportions,ACC 1 andACC 2, we pool
these proportions (assuming thatACC 1 andACC 2 are the performances of two models estimated
on two indendent test sets of sizen1 andn2, respectively),
ACC 1,2 = ACC 1×n1 +ACC 2×n2
n1 +n2
,
and compute the standard deviation as
σ1,2 =
√
ACC 1,2(1−ACC 1,2)×
( 1
n1
+ 1
n2
)
,
such that we can compute the z-score,
z = ACC 1−ACC 2
σ1,2
.
Since, due to using the same test set (and violating the independence assumption) we have n1 =
n2 =n, so that we can simplify the z-score computation to
z = ACC 1−ACC 2√
2σ2 = ACC 1−ACC 2√
2·ACC 1,2(1−ACC 1,2))/n
.
whereACC 1,2 is simply (ACC 1 +ACC 2)/2.
In the second step, based on the computedz value (this assumes the test errors are independent, which
is usually violated in practice as we use the same test set) we can reject the null hypothesis that the
pair of models has equal performance (here, measured in "classiﬁcation accuracy") at anα = 0.05
level if|z| is higher than 1.96. Alternatively, if we want to put in the extra work, we can compute
the area under the standard normal cumulative distribution at the z-score threshold. If we ﬁnd this
p-value is smaller than a signiﬁcance level we set before conducting the test, then we can reject the
null hypothesis at that given signiﬁcance level.
The problem with this test though is that we use the same test set to compute the accuracy of the two
classiﬁers; thus, it might be better to use a paired test such as a paired samplet-test, but a more robust
alternative is the McNemar test illustrated in the next section.
4.3 Comparing Two Models with the McNemar Test
So, instead of using the "difference of proportions" test, Dietterich [ Dietterich, 1998] found that
the McNemar test is to be preferred. The McNemar test, introduced by Quinn McNemar in 1947
[McNemar, 1947], is a non-parametric statistical test for paired comparisons that can be applied to
compare the performance of two machine learning classiﬁers.
Often, McNemar’s test is also referred to as "within-subjects chi-squared test," and it is applied to
paired nominal data based on a version of 2x2 confusion matrix (sometimes also referred to as 2x2
contingency table) that compares the predictions of two models to each other (not be confused with
the typical confusion matrices encountered in machine learning, which are listing false positive, true

positive, false negative, and true negative counts of a single model). The layout of the 2x2 confusion
matrix suitable for McNemar’s test is shown in Figure 19.
Given such a 2x2 confusion matrix as shown in Figure 19, we can compute the accuracy of a Model
1 via (A +B)/(A +B +C +D), whereA +B +C +D is the total number of test examplesn.
Similarly, we can compute the accuracy of Model 2 as (A +C)/n. The most interesting numbers
in this table are in cells B and C, though, as A and D merely count the number of samples where
both Model 1 and Model 2 made correct or wrong predictions, respectively. Cells B and C (the
off-diagonal entries), however, tell us how the models differ. To illustrate this point, let us take a look
at the following example:

Figure 20: Confusion matrix for exemplary classiﬁcation outcomes of two models, Model 1 and
Model 2.
In both subpanels, A and B, in Figure 20, the accuracy of Model 1 and Model 2 are 99.6% and 99.7%,
respectively.
• Model 1 accuracy subpanel A: (9959 + 11)/10000× 100% = 99.7%
36
• Model 1 accuracy subpanel B: (9945 + 25)/10000× 100% = 99.7%
• Model 2 accuracy subpanel A: (9959 + 1)/10000× 100% = 99.6%
• Model 2 accuracy subpanel B: (9945 + 15)/10000× 100% = 99.6%
Now, in subpanel A, we can see that Model 1 got 11 predictions right that Model 2 got wrong. Vice
versa, Model 2 got one prediction right that Model 1 got wrong. Thus, based on this 11:1 ratio,
we may conclude, based on our intuition, that Model 1 performs substantially better than Model 2.
However, in subpanel B, the Model 1:Model 2 ratio is 25:15, which is less conclusive about which
model is the better one to choose. This is a good example where McNemar’s test can come in handy.
In McNemar’s Test, we formulate the null hypothesis that the probabilitiesp(B) andp(C) – where
B andC refer to the confusion matrix cells introduced in an earlier ﬁgure – are the same, or in
simpliﬁed terms: None of the two models performs better than the other. Thus, we might consider
the alternative hypothesis that the performances of the two models are not equal.
The McNemar test statistic ("chi-squared") can be computed as follows:
χ2 = (B−C)2
B +C .
After setting a signiﬁcance threshold, for example,α = 0.05, we can compute ap-value – assuming
that the null hypothesis is true, thep-value is the probability of observing the given empirical (or a
larger)χ2-squared value. If thep-value is lower than our chosen signiﬁcance level, we can reject the
null hypothesis that the two models’ performances are equal.
Since the McNemar test statistic,χ2, follows aχ2 distribution with one degree of freedom (assuming
the null hypothesis and relatively large numbers in cells B and C, say > 25), we can now use our
favorite software package to "look up" the (1-tail) probability via theχ2 probability distribution with
one degree of freedom.
If we did this for scenario B in the previous ﬁgure (χ2 = 2.5), we would obtain ap-value of 0.1138,
which is larger than our signiﬁcance threshold, and thus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Now,
if we computed thep-value for scenario A (χ2 = 8.3), we would obtain ap-value of 0.0039, which is
below the set signiﬁcance threshold (α = 0.05) and leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis; we
can conclude that the models’ performances are different (for instance, Model 1 performs better than
Model 2).
Approximately one year after Quinn McNemar published the McNemar Test [McNemar, 1947], Allen
L. Edwards [Edwards, 1948] proposed a continuity corrected version, which is the more commonly
used variant today:
χ2 =
(
|B−C|− 1
)2
B +C .
In particular, Edwards wrote:
This correction will have the apparent result of reducing the absolute value of the
difference, [B - C], by unity.
According to Edward, this continuity correction increases the usefulness and accuracy of McNemar’s
test if we are dealing with discrete frequencies and the data is evaluated regarding the chi-squared
distribution.
A function for using McNemar’s test is implemented in MLxtend [Raschka, 2018].10
4.4 Exact p-Values via the Binomial Test
While McNemar’s test approximates thep-values reasonably well if the values in cells B and C are
larger than 50 (referring to the 2x2 confusion matrix shown earlier), for example, it makes sense
10http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/mcnemar/
37
to use a computationally more expensive binomial test to compute the exactp-values if the values
of B and C are relatively small – since the chi-squared value from McNemar’s test may not be
well-approximated by the chi-squared distribution.
The exactp-value can be computed as follows (based on the fact that McNemar’s test, under the null
hypothesis, is essentially a binomial test with proportion 0.5):
p = 2
n∑
i=B
(n
i
)
0.5i(1− 0.5)n−i,
wheren =B +C, and the factor 2 is used to compute the two-sided p-value (here,n is not to be
confused with the test set sizen).
The heat map shown in Figure 21 illustrates the differences between the McNemar approximation
of the chi-squared value (with and without Edward’s continuity correction) to the exact p-values
computed via the binomial test.

As we can see in Figure 21, thep-values from the continuity-corrected version of McNemar’s test
are almost identical to the p-values from a binomial test if both B and C are larger than 50. (The
MLxtend function, "mcnemar," provides different options for toggling between the regular and the
corrected McNemar test as well as including an option to compute the exactp-values.11)
4.5 Multiple Hypotheses Testing
In the previous section, we discussed how we could compare two machine learning classiﬁers using
McNemar’s test. However, in practice, we often have more than two models that we like to compare
based on their estimated generalization performance – for instance, the predictions on an independent
test set. Now, applying the testing procedure described earlier multiple times will result in a typical
issue called "multiple hypotheses testing." A common approach for dealing with such scenarios is the
following:
1. Conduct an omnibus test under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the
classiﬁcation accuracies.
2. If the omnibus test led to the rejection of the null hypothesis, conduct pairwise post hoc tests,
with adjustments for multiple comparisons, to determine where the differences between the
model performances occurred. (Here, we could use McNemar’s test, for example.)
Omnibus tests are statistical tests designed to check whether random samples depart from a null
hypothesis. A popular example of an omnibus test is the so-called Analysis of Variance (ANOV A),
11http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/mcnemar/
38
which is a procedure for analyzing the differences between group means. In other words, ANOV A is
commonly used for testing the signiﬁcance of the null hypothesis that the means of several groups are
equal. To compare multiple machine learning models, Cochran’sQ test would be a possible choice,
which is essentially a generalized version of McNemar’s test for three or more models. However,
omnibus tests are overall signiﬁcance tests that do not provide information about how the different
models differ – omnibus tests such as Cochran’sQ only tell us that a group of models differs or not.
Since omnibus tests can tell us that but not how models differ, we can perform post hoc tests if
an omnibus test leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis. In other words, if we successfully
rejected the null hypothesis that the performance of three or models is the same at a predetermined
signiﬁcance threshold, we may conclude that there is at least one signiﬁcant difference among the
different models.
By deﬁnition, post hoc testing procedures do not require any prior plan for testing. Hence, post
hoc testing procedures may have a bad reputation and may be regarded as "ﬁshing expeditions" or
"searching for the needle in the haystack," because no hypothesis is clear beforehand in terms of
which models should be compared, so that it is required to compare all possible pairs of models with
each other, which leads to the multiple hypothesis problems that we brieﬂy discussed in Section
3. However, please keep in mind that these are all approximations and everything concerning
statistical tests and reusing test sets (independence violation) should be taken with (at least) a
grain of salt.
For the post hoc procedure, we could use one of the many correction terms, for example, Bonferroni’s
correction [Bonferroni, 1936, Dunn, 1961] for multiple hypothesis testing. In a nutshell, where a
given signiﬁcance threshold (or α-level) may be appropriate for a single comparison between to
models, it is not suitable for multiple pair-wise comparisons. For instance, using the Bonferroni
correction is a means to reduce the false positive rate in multiple comparison tests by adjusting the
signiﬁcance threshold to be more conservative.
The next two sections will discuss two omnibus tests, Cochran’sQ test and theF -test for comparing
multiple classiﬁers on the same test set proposed by Looney [Looney, 1988].
4.6 Cochran’s Q Test for Comparing the Performance of Multiple Classiﬁers
Cochran’sQ test can be regarded as a generalized version of McNemar’s test that can be applied to
compare three or more classiﬁers. In a sense, Cochran’sQ test is similar to ANOV A but for paired
nominal data. Similar to ANOV A, it does not provide us with information about which groups (or
models) differ – only tells us that there is a difference among the models.
The test statisticQ is approximately, (similar to McNemar’s test), distributed as chi-squared with
M− 1 degrees of freedom, where M is the number of models we evaluate (since M = 2 for
McNemar’s test, McNemar’s test statistic approximates a chi-squared distribution with one degree of
freedom).
More formally, Cochran’sQ test tests the null hypothesis (H0) that there is no difference between the
classiﬁcation accuracies [Fleiss et al., 2013]:
H0 :ACC 1 =ACC 2 =... =ACCM.
Let{C1,...,C M} be a set of classiﬁers who have all been tested on the same dataset. If the M
classiﬁers do not differ in terms of their performance, then the following Q statistic is distributed
approximately as "chi-squared" withM− 1 degrees of freedom:
Q = (M− 1)M∑M
i=1G2
i−T 2
MT−∑n
j=1M 2
j
.
Here,Gi is the number of objects out of then test examples correctly classiﬁed byCi = 1,...M ;
Mj is the number of classiﬁers out ofM that correctly classiﬁed thejth example in the test dataset;
andT is the total number of correct number of votes among theM classiﬁers [Kuncheva, 2004]:
T =
M∑
i=1
; Gi =
N∑
j=1
Mj.
39
To perform Cochran’sQ test, we typically organize the classiﬁer predictions in a binary n×M
matrix (number of test examples vs. the number of classiﬁers). The ijth entry of such matrix is 0 if a
classiﬁerCj has misclassiﬁed a data example (vector) xi and 1 otherwise (if the classiﬁer predicted
the class labelf(xi) correctly).
Applied to an example dataset that was taken from [Kuncheva, 2004], the procedure below illustrates
how the classiﬁcation results may be organized. For instance, assume we have the ground truth labels
of the test dataset ytrue
and the following predictions on the test set by 3 classiﬁers (yC1, yC2, and yC3):
ytrue = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

(47)
yC1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
(49)
yC3 = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1].
(50)
We can then tabulate the correct (1) and incorrect (0) classiﬁcations as shown in Table 2.
By plugging in the respective value into the previous equation, we obtain the followingQ value:
Q = 2× 3× (842 + 922 + 922)− 2682
3× 268− (80× 9 + 11× 4 + 6× 1)≈ 7.5294. (51)
Now, theQ value (approximatingχ2) corresponds to ap-value of approximately 0.023 assuming a
χ2 distribution withM− 1 = 2 degrees of freedom. Assuming that we chose a signiﬁcance level
ofα = 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis that all classiﬁers perform equally well, since
0.023<α . (An implementation of Cochran’sQ test is provided in MLxtend [Raschka, 2018].12)
In practice, if we successfully rejected the null hypothesis, we could perform multiple post hoc
pair-wise tests – for example, McNemar’s test with a Bonferroni correction – to determine which
pairs have different population proportions. Unfortunately, numerous comparisons are usually very
tricky in practice. Peter H. Westfall, James F. Troendl, and Gene Pennello wrote a nice article
on how to approach such situations where we want to compare multiple models to each other
[Westfall et al., 2010].

Type I errors [False Positives] cannot decrease (the whole point of Bonferroni
adjustments) without inﬂating type II errors (the probability of accepting the null
hypothesis when the alternative is true) [Rothman, 1990]. And type II errors [False
Negatives] are no less false than type I errors.
Eventually, once more it comes down to the "no free lunch" – in this context, let us refer of it as
the "no free lunch theorem of statistical tests." However, statistical testing frameworks can be a
valuable aid in decision making. So, in practice, if we are honest and rigorous, the process of multiple
hypothesis testing with appropriate corrections can be a useful aid in decision making. However,
we have to be careful that we do not put too much emphasis on such procedures when it comes to
assessing evidence in data.
4.7 The F -test for Comparing Multiple Classiﬁers
Almost ironically, Cochran noted that in his work on theQ test [Cochran, 1950]
If the data had been measured variables that appeared normally distributed, instead
of a collection of 1’s and 0’s, theF -test would be almost automatically applied as
the appropriate method. Without having looked into that matter, I had once or twice
suggested to research workers that theF -test might serve as an approximation even
when the table consists of 1’s and 0’s
The method of using the F -test for comparing two classiﬁers in this section is somewhat loosely
based on Looney [Looney, 1988], whereas it shall be noted that Looney recommends an adjusted
version calledF + test.
In the context of theF -test, our null hypothesis is again that there that there is no difference between
the classiﬁcation accuracies:
pi :H0 =p1 =p2 =··· =pL.
Let{C1,...,C M} be a set of classiﬁers which have all been tested on the same dataset. If the M
classiﬁers do not perform differently, then the F statistic is distributed according to an F distribution
with (M− 1) and (M− 1)×n degrees of freedom, wheren is the number of examples in the test
set. The calculation of the F statistic consists of several components, which are listed below (adopted
from [Looney, 1988]).
We start by deﬁningACCavg as the average of the accuracies of the different models
ACCavg = 1
M
M∑
j=1
ACCj.
41
The sum of squares of the classiﬁers is then computed as
SSA =n
M∑
j=1
(Gj)2−n·M·ACCavg,
whereGj is the proportion of then examples classiﬁed correctly by classiﬁerj.
The sum of squares for the objects is calculated as follows:
SSB = 1
M
n∑
j=1
(Mj)2−M·n·ACC 2
avg.
Here, Mj is the number of classiﬁers out of M that correctly classiﬁed object xj ∈ Xn, where
Xn ={x1,... xn} is the test dataset on which the classiﬁers are tested on.
Finally, we compute the total sum of squares,
SST =M·n·ACCavg(1−ACCavg),
so that we then can compute the sum of squares for the classiﬁcation–object interaction:
SSAB =SST−SSA−SSB.
To compute the F statistic, we next compute the mean SSA and mean SSAB values:
MSA = SSA
M− 1,
and
MSAB = SSAB
(M− 1)(n− 1).
From the MSA and MSAB, we can then calculate theF -value as
F = MSA
MSAB .
After computing theF -value, we can then look up thep-value from an F-distribution table for the
corresponding degrees of freedom or obtain it computationally from a cumulative F-distribution
function. In practice, if we successfully rejected the null hypothesis at a previously chosen signiﬁcance
threshold, we could perform multiple post hoc pair-wise tests – for example, McNemar tests with a
Bonferroni correction – to determine which pairs have different population proportions.
An implementation of thisF -test is available via MLxtend [Raschka, 2018].13
4.8 Comparing Algorithms
The previously described statistical tests focused on model comparisons and thus do not take the
variance of the training sets into account, which can be an issue especially if training sets are small
and learning algorithms are susceptible to perturbations in the training sets.
However, if we consider the comparison between sets of models where each set has been ﬁt to
different training sets, we conceptually shift from a model compared to an algorithm comparison task.
This is often desirable, though. For instance, assume we develop a new learning algorithm or want to
decide which learning algorithm is best to ship with our new software (a trivial example would be an
13http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/ftest
42
email program with a learning algorithm that learns how to ﬁlter spam based on the user’s decisions).
In this case, we are want to ﬁnd out how different algorithms perform on datasets from a similar
problem domain.
One of the commonly used techniques for algorithm comparison is Thomas Dietterich’s 5x2-Fold
Cross-Validation method (5x2cv for short) that was introduced in his paper "Approximate statistical
tests for comparing supervised classiﬁcation learning algorithms" [ Dietterich, 1998]. It is a nice
paper that discusses all the different testing scenarios (the different circumstances and applications
for model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection) in the context of statistical tests. The
conclusions that can be drawn from empirical comparison on simulated datasets are summarized
below.
1. McNemar’s test:
• low false positive rate
• fast, only needs to be executed once
2. The difference in proportions test:
• high false positive rate (here, incorrectly detected a difference when there is none)
• cheap to compute, though
3. Resampled paired t-test:
• high false positive rate
• computationally very expensive
4. k-fold cross-validatedt-test:
• somewhat elated false positive rate
• requires reﬁtting to training sets; k times more computations than McNemar’s test
5. 5x2cv paired t-test
• low false positive rate (similar to McNemar’s test)
• slightly more powerful than McNemar’s test; recommended if computational efﬁciency
(runtime) is not an issue (10 times more computations than McNemar’s test)
The bottom line is that McNemar’s test is a good choice if the datasets are relatively large and/or the
model ﬁtting can only be conducted once. If the repeated ﬁtting of the models is possible, the 5x2cv
test is a good choice as it also considers the effect of varying or resampled training sets on the model
ﬁtting.
For completeness, the next section will summarize the mechanics of the tests we have not covered
thus far.
4.9 Resampled Paired t-Test
Resampled paired t-test procedure (also called k-hold-out paired t-test) is a popular method for
comparing the performance of two models (classiﬁers or regressors); however, this method has many
drawbacks and is not recommended to be used in practice as Dietterich [Dietterich, 1998] noted.
To explain how this method works, let us consider two classiﬁers C1 andC2. Further, we have a
labeled dataset S. In the common hold-out method, we typically split the dataset into 2 parts: a
training and a test set. In the resampled paired t-test procedure, we repeat this splitting procedure
(with typically 2/3 training data and 1/3 test data)k times (usually 30 or more). In each iteration, we
ﬁt bothC1 andC2 on the same training set and evaluate these on the same test set. Then, we compute
the difference in performance betweenC1 andC2 in each iteration so that we obtain k difference
measures. Now, by making the assumption that thesek differences were independently drawn and
follow an approximately normal distribution, we can compute the following t statistic withk− 1
degrees of freedom according to Student’st-test, under the null hypothesis that the modelsC1 and
C2 have equal performance:
t = ACCavg
√
k√∑k
i=1(ACCi−ACCavg)2/(k− 1)
.
43
Here,ACCi computes the difference between the model accuracies in the ith iteration ACCi =
ACCi,C1−ACCi,C2 andACCavg represents the average difference between the classiﬁer perfor-
mancesACCavg = 1
k
∑k
i=1ACCi.
Once we computed the t statistic, we can calculate the p-value and compare it to our chosen
signiﬁcance level, for example, α = 0.05. If the p-value is smaller than α, we reject the null
hypothesis and accept that there is a signiﬁcant difference between the two models.
The problem with this method, and the reason why it is not recommended to be used in practice, is
that it violates the assumptions of Student’st-test, as the differences of the model performances are
not normally distributed because the accuracies are not independent (since we compute them on the
same test set). Also, the differences between the accuracies themselves are also not independent since
the test sets overlap upon resampling. Hence, in practice, it is not recommended to use this test in
practice. However, for comparison studies, this test is implemented in MLxtend[Raschka, 2018].14.
4.10 k-fold Cross-validated Pairedt-Test
Similar to the resampled pairedt-test, thek-fold cross-validated pairedt-test is a statistical testing
technique that is very common in (older) literature. While it addresses some of the drawbacks of the
resampled pairedt-test procedure, this method has still the problem that the training sets overlap and
is hence also not recommended to be used in practice [Dietterich, 1998].
Again, for completeness, the method is outlined below. The procedure is basically equivalent to that
of the resampled pairedt-test procedure except that we usek-fold cross validation instead of simple
resampling, such that if we compute thet value,
t = ACCavg
√
k√∑k
i=1(ACCi−ACCavg)2/(k− 1)
,
k is equal to the number of cross-validation rounds. Again, for comparison studies, I made this this
testing procedure available through MLxtend [Raschka, 2018].15
4.11 Dietterich’s 5x2-Fold Cross-Validated Paired t-Test
The 5x2cv paired t-test is a procedure for comparing the performance of two models (classiﬁers
or regressors) that was proposed by Dietterich (Dietterich, 1998) to address shortcomings in other
methods such as the resampled pairedt-test and thek-fold cross-validated pairedt-test, which were
outlined in the previous two sections.
While the overall approach is similar to the previously describedt-test variants, in the 5x2cv paired
t-test, we repeat the splitting (50% training and 50% test data) ﬁve times.
In each of the 5 iterations, we ﬁt two classiﬁers C1 andC2 to the training split and evaluate their
performance on the test split. Then, we rotate the training and test sets (the training set becomes the
test set and vice versa) compute the performance again, which results in two performance difference
measures:
ACCA =ACCA,C1−ACCA,C2,
and
ACCB =ACCB,C1−ACCB,C2.
Then, we estimate the estimate mean and variance of the differences:
ACCavg = (ACCA +ACCB)/2,
and

15http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/paired_ttest_kfold_cv/
44
s2 = (ACCA−ACCavg)2 + (ACCB−ACC 2
avg)2.
The variance of the difference is computed for the 5 iterations and then used to compute thet statistic
as follows:
t = ACCA,1√
(1/5)∑5
i=1s2
i
,
whereACCA,1 is theACCA obtained from the ﬁrst iteration.
Thet statistic approximately follows as t distribution with 5 degrees of freedom, under the null
hypothesis that the modelsC1 andC2 have equal performance. Using thet statistic, thep-value can
then be computed and compared with a previously chosen signiﬁcance level, for example,α = 0.05.
If thep-value is smaller thanα, we reject the null hypothesis and accept that there is a signiﬁcant
difference in the two models. The 5x2cv pairedt-test is available from MLxtend [Raschka, 2018].16
4.12 Alpaydin’s Combined 5x2cv F -test
The 5x2cv combined F -test is a procedure for comparing the performance of models (classiﬁers
or regressors) that was proposed by Alpaydin [ Alpaydin, 1999] as a more robust alternative to
Dietterich’s 5x2cv pairedt-test procedure outlined in the previous section.
To explain how this mechanics of this method, let us consider two classiﬁers 1 and 2 and re-use the
notation from the previous section. The F statistic is then computed as follows:
f =
∑5
i=1
∑2
j=1(ACCi,j)2
2∑5
i=1s2
i
,
which is approximatelyF distributed with 10 and 5 degrees of freedom. The combined 5x2cvF -test
is available from MLxtend [Raschka, 2018].17.
4.13 Effect size
While (unfortunately rarely done in practice), we may also want to consider effect sizes since large
samples elevatep-values and can make everything seem statistically signiﬁcant. In other words,
"theoretical signiﬁcance" does not imply "practical signiﬁcance." As effect size is a more of an
objective topic that depends on the problem/task/question at hand, a detailed discussion is obviously
out of the scope of this article.
4.14 Nested Cross-Validation
In practical applications, we usually never have the luxury of having a large (or, ideally inﬁnitely)
sized test set, which would provide us with an unbiased estimate of the true generalization error of a
model. Hence, we are always on a quest of ﬁnding "better" workaround for dealing with size-limited
datasets: Reserving too much data for training results in unreliable estimates of the generalization
performance, and setting aside too much data for testing results in too little data for training, which
hurts model performance.
Almost always, we also do not know the ideal settings of the learning algorithm for a given problem or
problem domain. Hence, we need to use an available training set for hyperparameter tuning and model
selection. We established earlier that we could usek-fold cross-validation as a method for these tasks.
However, if we select the "best hyperparameter settings" based on the averagek-fold performance or
the *same* test set, we introduce a bias into the procedure, and our model performance estimates
will not be unbiased anymore. Mainly, we can think of model selection as another training procedure,
and hence, we would need a decently-sized, independent test set that we have not seen before to get
an unbiased estimate of the models’ performance. Often, this is not affordable.

In recent years, a technique called nested cross-validation has emerged as one of the popular or
somewhat recommended methods for comparing machine learning algorithms; it was likely ﬁrst
described by Iizuka [ Iizuka et al., 2003] and Varma and Simon [ Varma and Simon, 2006] when
working with small datasets. The nested cross-validation procedure offers a workaround for small-
dataset situations that shows a low bias in practice where reserving data for independent test sets is
not feasible.
Varma and Simon found that the nested cross-validation approach can reduce the bias, compared
to regular k-fold cross-validation when used for both hyperparameter tuning and evaluation, can
be considerably be reduced. As the researchers state, "A nested CV procedure provides an almost
unbiased estimate of the true error" [Varma and Simon, 2006].
The method of nested cross-validation is relatively straight-forward as it merely is a nesting of two
k-fold cross-validation loops: the inner loop is responsible for the model selection, and the outer loop
is responsible for estimating the generalization accuracy, as shown in Figure 22.

Note that in this particular case, this is a 5x2 setup (5-fold cross-validation in the outer loop, and
2-fold cross-validation in the inner loop). However, this is not the same as Dietterich’s 5x2cv method,
which is an often confused scenario such that I want to highlight it here.

4.15 Conclusions
Since "a picture is worth a thousand words," I want to conclude this series on model evaluation,
model selection, and algorithm selection with a diagram (Figure 23) that summarizes my personal
recommendations based on the concepts and literature that was reviewed.
It should be stressed that parametric tests for comparing model performances usually violate one or
more independent assumptions (the models are not independent because the same training set was
used, and the estimated generalization performances are not independent because the same test set
was used.). In an ideal world, we would have access to the data generating distribution or at least an

almost inﬁnite pool of new data. However, in most practical applications, the size of the dataset is
limited; hence, we can use one of the statistical tests discussed in this article as a heuristic to aid our
decision making.
Note that the recommendations I listed in the ﬁgure above are suggestions and depend on the problem
at hand. For instance, large test datasets (where "large" is relative but might refer to thousands or
millions of data records), can provide reliable estimates of the generalization performance, whereas
using a single training and test set when only a few data records are available can be problematic for
several reasons discussed throughout Section 2 and Section 3. If the dataset is very small, it might
not be feasible to set aside data for testing, and in such cases, we can use k-fold cross-validation
with a largek or Leave-one-out cross-validation as a workaround for evaluating the generalization
performance. However, using these procedures, we have to bear in mind that we then do not
compare between models but different algorithms that produce different models on the training
folds. Nonetheless, the average performance over the different test folds can serve as an estimate for
47
the generalization performance (Section 3) discussed the various implications for the bias and the
variance of this estimate as a function of the number of folds).
For model comparisons, we usually do not have multiple independent test sets to evaluate the models
on, so we can again resort to cross-validation procedures such ask-fold cross-validation, the 5x2cv
method, or nested cross-validation. As Gael Varoquaux [Varoquaux, 2017] writes:
Cross-validation is not a silver bullet. However, it is the best tool available, because
it is the only non-parametric method to test for model generalization.
